Project analysis:
The goal of this project is to create a web CV that showcases my personal and professional profile to potential employers and other interested parties. I want to use this web CV as a dynamic and interactive portfolio of my achievements, skills and experiences throughout my university years and beyond.

To design the web CV, I followed these steps:
- Target user profile: I identified the main audience for my web CV as companies that might want to hire me in the future, as well as anyone who wants to learn more about me and my background. I considered their needs, expectations and preferences when creating the content and structure of the web CV.

- Information architecture: I organized the information on the web CV into logical and coherent sections that reflect the categories of my CV. For now, the web CV has the same content as my CV, but I plan to update it regularly with new information and projects. The web CV consists of a main page with a brief introduction and a link to the index page, where all the sections are listed. The sections are: skills, academic education, work experience and languages. Each section has a link to go back to the index page.

- Visual design: I chose a color palette, a typography and a page layout that match the style and tone of my web CV. The color palette is composed of four colors: #809BCE, #95B8D1, #B8E0D2, #D6EADF and #4C5A74. These colors create a harmonious and professional contrast that enhances the readability and aesthetics of the web CV. The typography is Inria Sans, a modern and elegant font that suits the purpose and audience of the web CV. The page layout is simple and clear, with a main column for the content and a sidebar for the index on the right side.
